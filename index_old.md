    **Due to cov-19, many authors cannot attend the workshop in person. After discussing with other organisers, the workshop will be organised in a hybrid mode. An official announcement and a poster upload link will come later.**

Recent years have witnessed the rising need for machine learning systems that can interact with humans in the learning loop. Such systems can be applied to computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Creating and running such systems call for interdisciplinary research of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering design, which we abstract as Human in the Loop Learning (HiLL). 

The HiLL workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on the broad areas of HiLL, ranging from interactive/active learning algorithms for real-world decision-making systems (e.g., autonomous driving vehicles, robotic systems, etc.), human-inspired learning that mitigates the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence, human-machine collaborative learning that creates a more powerful learning system, lifelong learning that transfers knowledge to learn new tasks over a lifetime, as well as interactive system designs  (e.g., data visualization, annotation systems, etc.). 

The HiLL workshop continues the previous effort to provide a platform for researchers from interdisciplinary areas to share their recent research. In this year’s workshop, a special feature is to encourage the discussion on the interactive and collaborative learning between human and machine learning agents: Can they be organically combined to create a more powerful learning system? We believe the theme of the workshop will be of interest to broad NeurIPS attendees, especially those who are interested in interdisciplinary study. 

# Call for Papers
We welcome high-quality submissions on algorithms and system designs in the broad area of human in the loop learning. The topics of HiLL include but are not limited to:

-	Human-machine collaborative learning,
-	Human-inspired learning,
-	Interactive robot learning,
-	Interactive machine learning algorithms for autonomous decision-making systems,
-	Lifelong learning systems,
-	Online learning and active learning,
-	Psychology driven human concept learning,
-	Design, testing, and assessment of interactive systems for data analytics.

These topics span a variety of scientific disciplines and application domains like machine learning, human-computer interaction, cognitive science, and robotics. It is an opportunity for scientists in these disciplines to share their perspectives, discuss solutions to common problems and highlight the challenges in the field to help guide future research. The target audience for the workshop includes people who are interested in using machines to solve problems by having a human be an integral part of the learning process. 


We invite submissions of full papers, as well as works-in-progress, position papers, and papers describing open problems and challenges. While original contributions are preferred, we also invite submissions of high-quality work that has recently been published in other venues or is concurrently submitted. We encourage creative ML approaches, as well as interdisciplinarity and perspectives from outside traditional ML. **Papers should be 4-8 pages in length (excluding references, checklist and appendix) formatted using the [NeurIPS template](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/StyleFiles)**. All the submissions should be anonymous. The accepted papers are allowed to get submitted to other conference venues. 



Papers can be submitted through CMT:
